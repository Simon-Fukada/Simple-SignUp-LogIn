###### Personal Goal
I'm a super beginner to github and programming, so I'm using this project to help me familiarize myself with GitHub and practice my coding. I welcome all constructive criticism and guidance!!! :relaxed:  

###### Next Steps
So far I have confirmed that this code works with functional testing only, but I'd also like to practice unit testing. Therefore, this will be the next thing I add to the project as well as some try catch statments and validation to the text boxes.
